This is my personal repository of script dumps of various NES (and eventually FDS) games I'd like to see translated into English at some point.  All these scripts were made using the program, Cartographer.

Frequently Asked Questions

1.  How come are you using Cartographer?  Isn't there a more modern method of doing this?

Maybe, but this is what I've recently been accustomed to.

2.  There's a game I'd like a script dump made.  Can you make one and upload it here?

That depends if I even have the slightest interest in said game and if I can dump the script using Cartographer.

3.  What about games with their text compressed?

If I cannot use Cartographer to dump those scripts, that's something beyond my current skill level.

4.  Hey, I was wondering... I want to translate one of your scripts into English.  Can use download your scripts and...

PLEASE DO!!!  Heck, I might turn it into a full-fledged translation project if you can do that!  Of course, you will be credited for your efforts.

5.  What about translating from Japanese to something other than English?

I can't stop you from doing that.  Someone else will have to work on that as there's only two language I can understand fluently: English and Spanish.  (Spanish is my secondary language, so I may make mistakes there.)

6.  What about dumping games from another system?  Maybe from a game for Game Boy, Super NES, etc.

So far, I've learned how to dump scripts from NES and FDS games.  If I want to dump script from other consoles, I'd have to learn how it's possible.  More importantly, if it's a game that even interests me slightly.
