This is my personal repository of script dumps of various NES and FDS games I'd like to see translated into English at some point.  All these scripts were made using the program, Cartographer.

Frequently Asked Questions

1.  How come are you using Cartographer?  Isn't there a more modern method of doing this?

Maybe, but this is what I've recently been accustomed to.

2.  There's a game I'd like a script dump made.  Can you make one and upload it here?

That depends if I even have the slightest interest in said game and if I can dump the script using Cartographer.

3.  What about games with their text compressed?

If I cannot use Cartographer to dump those scripts, that's something beyond my current skill level.

4.  Hey, I was wondering... I want to translate one of your scripts into English.  Can I download any of your scripts and...

PLEASE DO!!!  Heck, I might turn it into a full-fledged translation project if you can do that!  Of course, you will be credited for your efforts.

5.  What about translating from Japanese to something other than English?

I can't stop you from doing that.  Someone else will have to work on that as there's only two language I can understand fluently: English and Spanish.  (Spanish is my secondary language, so I may make mistakes there.)

6.  What about dumping games from another system?  Maybe from a game for Game Boy, Super NES, etc.

So far, I've learned how to dump scripts from NES and FDS games.  If I want to dump scripts of games from other consoles, I'd have to learn how it's possible.  More importantly, if it's a game that even interests me slightly.

7.  I see there's, at least, one directory with RAW in its name.  Does this mean your other script dumps were cooked?

LOL, not like that!  Any directories with "RAW" in its name had its script dumped as raw data.  If it didn't have "RAW" in the name, that means the scripts were dumped through the text pointer tables in the game.

8.  So that means you haven't figured out the pointer system yet?

It just means I cannot dump the game's text using Cartographer's "POINTER_RELATIVE" option.  Or it could be done and I couldn't figure it out yet.

9.  What about the scripts marked with "MIX"?

Some text areas in the came could be dumped through the game's text pointer tables and some were dumped RAW.  That's why it's marked as "MIX".
