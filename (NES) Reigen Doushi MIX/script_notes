The file,  "Individual Lines.zip", containts the game's untranslated script dumped one line at a time.  The text pointers used in this game are not assembled in an organized table.  Instead, they're scattered above the text area in the second bank ($4010-$800F).  Thus, the text had to dumped this way via Cartographer.  The individual lines will have be assembles in one script file by hand so that the script (with English text) can be inserted via Atlas.
